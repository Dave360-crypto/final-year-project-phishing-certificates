# final-year-project-phishing-certificates
 
Code for my final year masters project on evaluation of TLS certificates of benign and phishing websites.

This includes Jupyter notebooks for filtering URL data, bash scripts for downloading the certificates, various notebooks for processing the downloaded certificates, and finally notebooks that produce the results for the report. Final datasets featuring information extracted from certificates are included.
